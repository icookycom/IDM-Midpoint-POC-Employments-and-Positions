Docker Engine
For the Docker Compose, the Docker environment is required. The requirement for this environment is the availability of the Docker Engine.

Docker documentation related to installation based on OS:
Linux - Docker Engine
The Docker Engine can be installed directly.

Windows - Docker Desktop
For Windows, the Docker Engine is only available as a part of the Docker Desktop application. Any configuration of Docker Desktop installation is suitable for our purpose. Feel free to follow the default setting during the installation process.
